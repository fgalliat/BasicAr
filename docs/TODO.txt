"SYSMENU.BAS" -> to SET mute, console, reset .... (customizable system menu)
  \___ can be called by F1 when in editor mode
  \___ TODO

host_getKey() to finish

DIR args -> check for executeMode

CONSOLE  -> can cause dead-locks

LIST on LIGHT5.BAS -> causes dead-locks (it doesn't on MP3.BAS)

MILLIS   -> function that returns millis from MCU boot

remove VGATxt + USBKbd double same port initialisation code (keep only one - VGAT)


SD2SER / SER2SD todo + later make as same for BT HC-06 (for wireless uploading)
|\___ impl. XON/XOFF protocol to increase commm. speed

 \__ as EXEC "FILE","SD2SER","LIGHT5.BAS" ?????


EXEC "FILE","DIRARRAY","AB$"[,"*.BAS"] -> AB$(.) feeded w/ "DIR *.BAS content"

ASC( STR$ ) : returns ascii code of 1st char of STR$
 \__ inv of CHR$(.)

* Serial Port Map *
Serial  -> USB UART                       => DONE
Serial2 -> BT HC-06
Serial3 -> kbd/vga text                   => DONE
Serial4 -> ESP-over-328 ---> may be replaced by a NodeMCU module ....
Serial5 -> DFPlayer mp3 module @ 9600 bps => DONE

___________________________________
DFPlayer mp3 module is 5v VCC / but 3.3v logical RX/TX @ 9600bps
 -> requires an uSDCard to work
 -> SDCARD need to have a /MP3/ in it & numbered files inside ex. 01_toto.mp3

OUT : out a char of ascii code                                                 ex. OUT 65 / OUT 0,65 -> to outchar to Serial specifically
INP : wait a single char \__ from current input -or- can specify a device ???? ex. K = INP(0)
SNS : read a single char /
CAT --> just display a plain file content (see LLIST) but not mandatory to Serial -> use current console device


OPEN / CLOSE (for files) + FINPUT / FPRINT (to not have to manage file descr literals ?????)

BEWARE : max 128 cmds --> else will distord 0x80 (end of token) descriptor
