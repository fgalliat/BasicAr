# BasicAr
Basic for Arduino (Xtase version)

EARLY STAGE of Basic adaptation for Arduino(like)...

Initialy based on Robin Edwards	work (https://github.com/robinhedwards/ArduinoBASIC)

Designed for Teensy serie (3.2 & 3.6 tested)

The software layout isn't finished & is provided as is (very dirty @ this time, I know)

See you later if you want better code ;-)
